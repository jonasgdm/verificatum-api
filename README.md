# üó≥Ô∏è Verificatum Java API

This project is a Java-based RESTful API built with Spring Boot to interact with the [Verificatum Mix-Net](https://www.verificatum.org/) using internal library calls rather than shelling out to CLI commands. It‚Äôs intended to power e-voting systems with mobility, threshold mix-nets, and future-ready support for asynchronous execution across multiple mix-servers.

## üöÄ Features

- Full Java integration with Verificatum‚Äôs internal library (no CLI required)
- Endpoint for protocol stub file generation (`-prot`)
- Spring Boot API, ready to integrate with frontends or orchestrators

## üì¶ Requirements

| Tool       | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Java       | 17      |
| Maven      | 3.x     |
| Git        | latest  |
| Curl       | optional for API testing |
| Linux      | required for native `.so` dependencies |


## ‚öôÔ∏è Clone, Build & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonasgdm/verificatum-api.git
cd verificatum-api
```

### ‚úÖ One-Time Native Library Setup (REQUIRED)

> Verificatum depends on a native library (libvecj-2.2.0.so) that must be accessible at runtime. Without this, the API will crash with java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError.

Run this inside the project folder:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The API will be available at:

`http://localhost:8080`

## üì° API Endpoints
### ‚ûï Generate Stub File

**GET** `/verificatum/generate-stub`

Generates a protocol stub (stub.xml) using internal Verificatum library functions (equivalent to vmni -prot).

üìù Output will appear in the root of the project (verificatum-api/stub.xml).

## üîú Next Steps

- Add endpoints for -party and -merge phases of vmni

- Allow parameterized requests for all fields

- Automate setup for multiple mix-servers (3 or more)

- Clean up and modularize configurations for LAN or distributed deployments

- Start writing integration tests and performance benchmarking

## Flask Backend

This Flask backend serves as a middleware layer between the user-facing frontend and the Verificatum Java API. It exposes a simplified API that orchestrates secure voting steps such as key generation, mixing, and decryption by communicating with external mixnet services. This architecture allows the frontend to remain lightweight and abstracted from cryptographic complexity.

### How to Run

1. Change to flask_backend directory

```
cd flask_backend
```

3. Create a Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv .venv
```

5. Install Independences

```
pip install flask
```

```
pip install flask-cors
```

7. Run the Flask Server

```
python app.py
```


Server will start at:
`http://localhost:5000`
